# 1. Arithmetic Operators
# Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction,
# multiplication, etc.

# +	 Addition
# -	 Subtraction
# *	 Multiplication
# /	 Division (Floating-point)
# // Floor Division (Quotient without remainder)
# %	 Modulus (Remainder)
# ** Exponentiation (Power)

a = 10
b = 3

# Addition
sum_result = a + b    # 13
print("Addition: ", sum_result)

# Subtraction
difference = a - b   # 7
print("Subtraction: ", difference)

# Multiplication
product = a * b      # 30
print("Multiplication: ", product)

# Division (floating-point)
quotient = a / b    # 3.333...
print("Division: ", quotient)

# Floor Division (Quotient without remainder)
floor_div = a // b  # 3 (removes decimal)
print("Floor Division: ", floor_div)

# Modulus (remainder)
modulus = a % b     # 1
print("Modulus: ", modulus)

# Exponentiation (Power)
power = a ** b     # 1000
print("Exponentiation: ", power)
